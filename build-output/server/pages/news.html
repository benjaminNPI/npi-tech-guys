While emails like “You have 1 new invitation” or “Your profile has been viewed by 63 people” can be authentic, it’s critical to verify the email address it’s sent from to ensure that it’s genuinely from LinkedIn. These impersonators will send emails that look identical to the real ones, with links to fake LinkedIn pages that will rip off your information as soon as you enter it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way cybercriminals leverage LinkedIn is by creating fake profiles and messaging people about job opportunities. Once you’re on the hook, they’ll either ask for a small payment upfront to process your application (that you’ll never see again) or send you a link to a form you must fill out that’s actually a phishing link in disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinkedIn is aware of the problem and is working on developing advanced security features to protect its users. Here are four of the current security features it has already deployed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuspicious Message Warnings\u003c/strong\u003e – LinkedIn’s technology can detect messages from people who are attempting to take you off the platform or are saying something potentially inappropriate and will send you a warning notification.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProfile Verification\u003c/strong\u003e – This feature allows you to verify your page’s authenticity. By submitting an additional form of ID, you can get a verification badge on your profile, so anyone who looks at it knows you are who you say you are. This is a valuable feature since scammers are always looking for fresh targets and have pages that get shut down quickly, so they don’t often bother keeping information up-to-date.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProfile Information\u003c/strong\u003e – This feature allows you to see the details of a person’s profile to help you determine whether or not to respond to a message, accept a connection request, trust an offer, etc. Under your profile, if you click “More” and select “About this profile” from the drop-down menu, you’ll see information like:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"list-style-type: none;\"\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen the profile was created.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen the profile was last updated.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhether the member has verified a phone number.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhether the member has a work email associated with their account.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003col start=\"4\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAI-Generated Profile Picture Detection\u003c/strong\u003e – Scammers will use AI to generate realistic profile pictures of fake people to create fake profiles used to scam users. Scarily, LinkedIn’s research showed that users were generally unable to visually distinguish real faces from these synthetically generated ones. As a result, LinkedIn partnered with Academia to develop and deploy advanced detection features that allow LinkedIn to detect AI-generated profile pictures and shut down their profiles before they cause problems.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you use LinkedIn to find jobs, employees, or clients? It’s a great resource for business, but it’s important to stay secure. However, LinkedIn’s features are just the first line of defense.

Even if their “out of office” email responder is active, many people will periodically check in on work at least once while traveling. Unfortunately, studies show that working outside of the office – whether it’s a few simple check-ins on vacation, connecting to the Internet at a local coffee shop, or even business travelers out on work trips – can lead to major cybersecurity issues. If you or your employees will be answering urgent emails from the airport or accessing network documents in the hotel lobby, it’s essential to maintain strong cybersecurity best practices to avoid exposing the company’s network to hackers preying nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this blog post, NPI will cover what cybersecurity best practices are necessary for you to take before and during any trip to keep your network secure from hackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy Cybersecurity Matters While Traveling\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCybersecurity might not be at the top of your vacation checklist, but ignoring it can turn your dream getaway into a horrible nightmare. Cybercriminals know summer is a prime time to attack because people are more likely to let their guard down while on vacation. For most vacationers, the focus is on enjoying time out of the office instead of ensuring they’re following cybersecurity best practices, making them an easy target for hackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo minimize the risk of a cyberattack while traveling, here are a few best practices to cover with anyone on your team who might connect to the Internet while on vacation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBefore You Go:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBack Up Your Data\u003c/strong\u003e – If your device gets lost or ruined, you’ll want a copy of your data available to be restored.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate Your Software\u003c/strong\u003e – Make sure your operating system software, web browsers, and apps have all been updated to the latest version. Outdated software can impact your device’s ability to defend against malware.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProtect Your Devices\u003c/strong\u003e – You should always lock your device using a PIN, passcode, fingerprint, or facial recognition feature, but if you don’t already, set this up before traveling. If you leave your device unattended and someone attempts to access it, they will have full access to your private information if it’s not locked.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnable “Find My Phone”\u003c/strong\u003e – This feature will allow you to locate your device if you lose it, but it also gives you the power to remotely wipe data or disable the device if it falls into the wrong hands.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhile Traveling:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUse a Virtual Private Network (VPN)\u003c/strong\u003e – A VPN encrypts your Internet connection, ensuring your data is secure even when you use public WiFi networks. Before you leave, set up a VPN on your devices and use it whenever you access the Internet.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon’t Connect to Public WiFi\u003c/strong\u003e – While public WiFi offers convenience, these networks can be a hotspot for cybercriminal activity. Avoid unprotected networks whenever possible. (Yes, that means no checking your email on the beach unless you have a VPN!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManage Location Services\u003c/strong\u003e – Location tools are useful for navigating new places but can also expose your location to criminals. Turn off location services when you’re not actively using that feature, and consider limiting how you share your location on social media.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnable Multifactor Authentication (MFA)\u003c/strong\u003e – MFA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second verification form, such as a text message code, authenticator code, or fingerprint scan. This feature should be enabled for all accounts containing sensitive information before leaving your house.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisable Auto-Connect Features\u003c/strong\u003e – Some devices automatically seek and connect to available wireless networks. These features can give cybercriminals access to your devices if you connect to the wrong network. Disable this option so you only connect to wireless and Bluetooth networks you know and trust.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should be able to relax on vacation. Taking these simple precautions can help you keep your device secure so you can enjoy your time off and don’t have to worry about dealing with cyber issues when you get back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it’s important to know that these steps aren’t fail-proof. To truly ensure that your company’s cybersecurity measures are up to standard, it’s important to work with a professional IT team that can monitor your network 24/7, patch any vulnerabilities that pop up (which happens regularly), and alert you if something seems suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help you prepare for your vacation and have peace of mind knowing your business is secure while you or your employees are working remotely, call NPI at \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e385-463-3366\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/discoverycall/\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e to schedule a FREE IT Security Risk Assessment with our cybersecurity experts today.

A cloud-based support platform offers some significant advantages that allow you to deliver remarkable customer experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Cloud-Based Customer Service Platforms Will Do For Your Business\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloud solutions allow your customer service team to access the tools and information they need to provide exceptional service remotely via the internet. Instead of relying on a system that stores and manages data onsite, which can present limitations in terms of storage, scalability, and connectivity, a cloud-based customer service platform provides a comprehensive suite of features that meet both customer and service agent needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you choose a cloud solution to level up your customer service, your business benefits from:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eReliability\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReliable cloud systems allow customers to contact your company via multiple methods, including phone, chat, and email.  This helps your customers feel like a priority, and the potential for service requests to fall through the cracks drops. You also don’t need to worry about the reliability of your onsite servers, thanks to a lower risk for crashes, glitches, or other problems that can arise with onsite systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSeamless Integration With Other Business Tools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA customer service platform that integrates with your other business tools, such as CRM or inventory management software, also improves service. These integrations can support self-serve or AI-driven tools, like chatbots, but also allow human service providers to access critical information they need to address customer concerns. Integrations can also streamline services by increasing accessibility to customer data: when someone contacts you, the cloud system can immediately route the message to the right person and automatically present pertinent information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eImproved Security\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloud solutions implement additional security measures to ensure the safety of data in transit and in storage, including encryption. Most cloud platforms also provide additional support for security, including services to prevent and mitigate breaches. This provides customers with increased confidence in your security protocols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eInsights From Real-Time Analytics\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best cloud-based customer service solutions provide real-time analytics and offer valuable insights into your customer service team’s performance, as well as the platform’s performance. You can easily measure performance indicators like the time to answer calls and the time spent on calls, or gather insights from chat logs, such as the most common customer queries or concerns, that you can use to improve other areas of your business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost-Effective Customer Service\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvesting in cloud solutions for customer service management helps improve cost efficiency without sacrificing service.

While I typically try to stay clear of Reddit and its gang of chronic whiny-pants commenters, I scrolled through a few, you know, for research purposes since I’m in the industry. A few of the complaints sounded so outlandish – like the lady who claimed the technician took a bathroom break in her attic – that it almost seemed impossible they could be true. However, other more common issues on the thread I’ve experienced myself, and to be candid with you, they sucked!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you are experiencing a tech emergency – be it a broken printer, hardware malfunctions, Internet connectivity issues, login troubles or something similar – poor tech support only worsens the irritation. It leaves you with frustrated employees who can’t efficiently get their jobs done because they’re troubleshooting their tech and on hold with an IT company that is “looking into it” and irritated customers who just want a smooth process when dealing with your organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can result in losing customers and A-player employees to your competitors that don’t have these same daily issues. At first, it might seem dramatic that a few unresolved “tech issues” could cause such a stir, but as these problems continue to repeat themselves, with no solution in sight, resentment grows and will eventually result in these people seeking organizations that don’t have to deal with such headaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you do to get ahead of the problem?\u003c/strong\u003e Start by polling your employees. Ask them questions that will help you “grade” your current IT company to see if they’re dealing with your team as fast and efficiently as they should. Here are a few questions to ask:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo you experience any recurring technical problems that haven’t been fully resolved?

Even big-time brands that you would expect to have top-of-the-line cybersecurity systems, processes and procedures in place fail to adequately protect themselves from insider threats. This August marks a year since two disgruntled Tesla employees went rogue after being let go and exposed the personal information – including names, addresses, phone numbers and even the Social Security numbers – of over 75,000 people, including employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, the issue is expected to get worse. According to NerdWallet, as of May 24, 2024, 298 US-based tech companies have laid off 84,600 workers and counting. This includes major layoffs at big companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft, as well as smaller tech start-ups. In total, around 257,254 jobs were eliminated in the first quarter of 2024 alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether or not you’ll need to downsize your team this year, having a proper offboarding process in place is essential to every business, big or small, because it’s more than a routine administrative task – it’s a critical security precaution. Failing to revoke access for former employees can lead to serious business and legal implications later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome of those issues include:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTheft Of Intellectual Property \u003c/strong\u003e–\u003cstrong\u003e Employees can sneak away with YOUR company’s files, client data and confidential information stored on personal devices\u003c/strong\u003e, as well as retain access to cloud-based applications like social media sites and file-sharing sites (Dropbox or OneDrive, for example) that your IT department doesn’t know about or forgets to change the password to. \u003cstrong\u003eA study by Osterman Research revealed that 69% of businesses experience data loss due to employee turnover, and 87% of employees who leave take data with them.\u003c/strong\u003e Most often, the information you worked hard to gather is sold to competitors, used by them when they’re hired by the competition or used by the former employee to BECOME a competitor. Any way you cut it, it screws YOU.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompliance Violations \u003c/strong\u003e– Failing to revoke access privileges and remove employees from authorized user lists can register you as noncompliant in heavily regulated industries.

If that data isn’t backed up, you will lose it ALL. And for those thinking, “I’ll sue them!” Rightfully so, but even if you do sue them and win, the hard reality is that the legal costs, time wasted on the lawsuit and recovering the data, plus the aggravation and distraction of dealing with it all, are greater costs than what you \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e get awarded if you win the lawsuit and \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e collect in damages.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eData Breach \u003c/strong\u003e– This could be the most terrifying of all. Unhappy employees who feel they have been wronged can make you the star of the next devastating data breach headline and incur a costly lawsuit to go with it. It could be as simple as making one click and downloading, exposing or modifying your clients’ or employees’ private information, financial records or even trade secrets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you have an airtight offboarding process to curb these risks? Chances are you don’t. A 2024 study by Wing revealed that one out of five organizations has indications that some of their former users were not properly offboarded, and those are the people who were astute enough to detect it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow DO you properly offboard an employee?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImplement The Principle Of Least Privilege\u003c/strong\u003e – Successful offboarding starts with proper onboarding.

Discover more about this process below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Is an IT Audit?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn IT audit is a thorough checkup and assessment of your IT infrastructure. The purpose is to make sure that all the systems and solutions are working correctly, the management and operation of the systems are in alignment with best practices, company policies, and applicable regulations, and that data is collected, used, and protected appropriately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore specifically, the process includes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEvaluating hardware and software to ensure that it’s working efficiently and identify opportunities for upgrades\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAssessing system performance and capacity and identifying areas for efficiency improvement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConducting compliance checks to ensure your company is following the rules of HIPAA, PCI-DSS, Security and Exchange Commission, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any other applicable standards\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConfirming documentation of IT processes, policies, and procedures to ensure they are complete, compliant, and up-to-date\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, regular IT audits also address security, identifying security vulnerabilities or loopholes that a cyber criminal could exploit to attack and harm your business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat You Gain From Regular IT Audits\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thorough IT audit is an important risk management tool. Much like a regular visit to your doctor allows them to catch minor concerns before they become a major health issue, checking up on your IT infrastructure ensures you identify small issues before they become big and expensive headaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe process of the audit itself requires planning, gathering data, and analysis. The insights that come from this effort become recommendations for improvement, and guide action plans moving forward. Although the process can be time-consuming, it offers your business a long list of benefits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA More Secure IT Environment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity audits help protect your business from malware, data breaches, and other threats. The process evaluates logical and physical security, data integrity and security, incident management procedures, and more, ensuring your company is doing everything possible to address threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eImproved Efficiency and Cost Savings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT audits identify areas of improvement that can help your business be more productive and efficient and, ultimately, save money. For example, a detailed review of the infrastructure and its capabilities may reveal areas that allow for automation or processes that could benefit from streamlining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBetter Compliance\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegular IT audits help you stay abreast of constantly changing compliance standards and industry standards.

This built-in password manager offers unique autofill, sync, and recovery features on all iPhones, iPads, and Mac products that your employees probably use to secure private information. However, Apple’s new password manager, announced at WWDC 2024, is about to take protection to another level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat Is the New Password Manager?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAs an extension of iCloud Keychain, the new standalone password manager app stores business passwords more safely and securely than ever.

Otherwise, Apple users rely on the Safari preferences window or Mac System Preferences to retrieve saved passwords. In these cases, information is spread out across platforms and disorganized.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eThe new Passwords app places all passwords in one easy-to-reach place. Furthermore, it automatically updates whenever you introduce a new smart product to your business space with a new password or code. You can easily secure more passwords, especially since this new iOS 18 feature allows you to sync Vision Pro headsets and PCs if you have the Windows app, which you couldn’t do before. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAll data remains clear and concise, from login credentials to Wi-Fi passwords, and the data automatically fills in, so you don’t have to waste time searching for the information. You can also share the credentials among trusted employees by granting them access to family- or business-sharing setups that facilitate manageability and fluency between devices. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eGenerating Codes and Providing Alerts for Optimal Safety\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eApple’s new password manager also has a hand in generating verification codes for optimal safety. For instance, if your employees use two-step verification to help reduce the potential for hacker threats and company data leaks, they can trust this system to create a unique one-time code and securely send it to them like an authenticator app. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eHowever, if the system notices unauthorized actions, it’ll quickly send security alerts to warn you and your employees about a potential threat. For instance, if someone uses a new device to log into the company account or changes certain passwords, a warning will go out to ensure your company authorized these actions. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eSo, if you’re ready to opt out of third-party passkey managers and into a more reliable one, credit Apple for its new password manager.

They also expect that password protection for sensitive data will stop unauthorized access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, single-factor authentication is no longer enough to fully secure your business networks and resources. Password theft is one of the leading causes of data breaches, with hackers using stolen credentials to access sensitive information and wreak havoc on businesses. However, by taking a multi-layered approach to cyber security that uses multi-factor authentication, you stand a better chance of thwarting bad actors and keeping your business data safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Is Multi-Factor Authentication?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe typical username and password combination that we’re all familiar with is a type of single-factor authentication. In order to access a protected asset, you only need a single factor (in this case, the password) to prove you have permission to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMulti-factor authentication requires several pieces of information for user verification. In most cases, these include the username and password, as well as another token, like a unique code. These additional authentication factors help ensure that even in the event of a password compromise, whoever has the password won’t be able to go any further because they don’t have the additional details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthentication factors can come in a variety of forms, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBiometrics,\u003c/strong\u003e such as a fingerprint or facial recognition\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMobile apps\u003c/strong\u003e that continuously generate one-time passwords to enter in addition to your standard username and password\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSMS texts\u003c/strong\u003e, which deliver a one-time code to a mobile device\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHardware tokens\u003c/strong\u003e, which are physical devices that generate one-time codes or that you insert into a device in addition to a password\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecurity questions\u003c/strong\u003e that the user establishes at account setup\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy You Need Multiple Security Layers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, implementing several security layers helps reduce the risk of many common cyber threats that can cost your business time and money. Considering that many small and midsize businesses never fully recover from a cyber attack, investing in multi-factor authentication is an important element of a robust approach to security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing multi-factor authentication offers several major advantages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIncreased Protection\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if you run a small business, there’s always a threat of attack. Hackers use a variety of methods to steal passwords, like brute force attacks, social engineering, and date packet sniffing, but if you have multi-factor authentication in place, simply getting those passwords isn’t enough to get into your network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRequiring additional information before granting access to sensitive assets allows your cyber security team to focus on other priorities. It’s just one tool of many that they can use to address the barrage of threats coming from every direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSimplicity\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing this type of security is easy.

Here are a few ideas for automating your small business loyalty program:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePersonalizing Customer Interactions = Better Experiences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink of shopping as research for your potential customers. They scroll through your site to see if you offer anything interesting. If they find something, they might click on it, save it, or even add it to the cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you aren’t recording how your customers’ research into your products or services is going, you can’t analyze them or make improvements to the shopping experience. That’s where the right technology comes in. With automated customer loyalty technology, you can:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNote browsing habits to better recommend similar products or styles.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePick up abandoned carts by retargeting ads, reducing prices, or offering someone an incentive to complete their purchase with you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStreamline personalization to strengthen each customer’s emotional connection to your brand.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFlaunting Incentives = Better Engagement\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow does your current system increase customer engagement?

Unlike with traditional paper punch cards or stickers, online programs give you an accurate and updated card count for customer loyalty measurement. You’ll even see how many rewards you currently owe so that you can budget resources efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not use advanced data analytics to show weaknesses in your program, remove any demotivating features, or make other parts of your strategy excel?

Quantum computers operate on different principles than traditional computers and could theoretically break encryption codes used today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis challenge is answered by post-quantum encryption. Even a powerful quantum computer would find it much harder to crack because it uses different mathematical principles than traditional encryption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eProtecting Against “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” Attacks \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother reason for post-quantum encryption is to guard against “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. In this scenario, attackers steal encrypted data today, knowing they can’t decrypt it yet. However, they hope to crack the code later with quantum computers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoom aims to make this type of attack ineffective by using post-quantum encryption. Even if attackers capture encrypted data from a Zoom meeting, they couldn’t decrypt it in the future, even with a quantum computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat This Means for Zoom Users \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new post-quantum E2EE is currently available for Zoom Meetings.
