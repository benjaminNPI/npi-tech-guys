While emails like “You have 1 new invitation” or “Your profile has been viewed by 63 people” can be authentic, it’s critical to verify the email address it’s sent from to ensure that it’s genuinely from LinkedIn. These impersonators will send emails that look identical to the real ones, with links to fake LinkedIn pages that will rip off your information as soon as you enter it.</p>\n<p>Another way cybercriminals leverage LinkedIn is by creating fake profiles and messaging people about job opportunities. Once you’re on the hook, they’ll either ask for a small payment upfront to process your application (that you’ll never see again) or send you a link to a form you must fill out that’s actually a phishing link in disguise.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn is aware of the problem and is working on developing advanced security features to protect its users. Here are four of the current security features it has already deployed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Suspicious Message Warnings</strong> – LinkedIn’s technology can detect messages from people who are attempting to take you off the platform or are saying something potentially inappropriate and will send you a warning notification.</li>\n<li><strong>Profile Verification</strong> – This feature allows you to verify your page’s authenticity. By submitting an additional form of ID, you can get a verification badge on your profile, so anyone who looks at it knows you are who you say you are. This is a valuable feature since scammers are always looking for fresh targets and have pages that get shut down quickly, so they don’t often bother keeping information up-to-date.</li>\n<li><strong>Profile Information</strong> – This feature allows you to see the details of a person’s profile to help you determine whether or not to respond to a message, accept a connection request, trust an offer, etc. Under your profile, if you click “More” and select “About this profile” from the drop-down menu, you’ll see information like:</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>When the profile was created.</li>\n<li>When the profile was last updated.</li>\n<li>Whether the member has verified a phone number.</li>\n<li>Whether the member has a work email associated with their account.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>AI-Generated Profile Picture Detection</strong> – Scammers will use AI to generate realistic profile pictures of fake people to create fake profiles used to scam users. Scarily, LinkedIn’s research showed that users were generally unable to visually distinguish real faces from these synthetically generated ones. As a result, LinkedIn partnered with Academia to develop and deploy advanced detection features that allow LinkedIn to detect AI-generated profile pictures and shut down their profiles before they cause problems.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do you use LinkedIn to find jobs, employees, or clients? It’s a great resource for business, but it’s important to stay secure. However, LinkedIn’s features are just the first line of defense. If someone in your organization were to fall for a scam and click a bad link, would your internal security solutions be enough to protect your network?</p>\n<p>NPI can help you find out.

Even if their “out of office” email responder is active, many people will periodically check in on work at least once while traveling. Unfortunately, studies show that working outside of the office – whether it’s a few simple check-ins on vacation, connecting to the Internet at a local coffee shop, or even business travelers out on work trips – can lead to major cybersecurity issues. If you or your employees will be answering urgent emails from the airport or accessing network documents in the hotel lobby, it’s essential to maintain strong cybersecurity best practices to avoid exposing the company’s network to hackers preying nearby.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, NPI will cover what cybersecurity best practices are necessary for you to take before and during any trip to keep your network secure from hackers.</p>\n<h3>Why Cybersecurity Matters While Traveling</h3>\n<p>Cybersecurity might not be at the top of your vacation checklist, but ignoring it can turn your dream getaway into a horrible nightmare. Cybercriminals know summer is a prime time to attack because people are more likely to let their guard down while on vacation. For most vacationers, the focus is on enjoying time out of the office instead of ensuring they’re following cybersecurity best practices, making them an easy target for hackers.</p>\n<p>To minimize the risk of a cyberattack while traveling, here are a few best practices to cover with anyone on your team who might connect to the Internet while on vacation.</p>\n<h3>Before You Go:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Back Up Your Data</strong> – If your device gets lost or ruined, you’ll want a copy of your data available to be restored.</li>\n<li><strong>Update Your Software</strong> – Make sure your operating system software, web browsers, and apps have all been updated to the latest version. Outdated software can impact your device’s ability to defend against malware.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect Your Devices</strong> – You should always lock your device using a PIN, passcode, fingerprint, or facial recognition feature, but if you don’t already, set this up before traveling. If you leave your device unattended and someone attempts to access it, they will have full access to your private information if it’s not locked.</li>\n<li><strong>Enable “Find My Phone”</strong> – This feature will allow you to locate your device if you lose it, but it also gives you the power to remotely wipe data or disable the device if it falls into the wrong hands.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>While Traveling:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong> – A VPN encrypts your Internet connection, ensuring your data is secure even when you use public WiFi networks. Before you leave, set up a VPN on your devices and use it whenever you access the Internet.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t Connect to Public WiFi</strong> – While public WiFi offers convenience, these networks can be a hotspot for cybercriminal activity. Avoid unprotected networks whenever possible. (Yes, that means no checking your email on the beach unless you have a VPN!)</li>\n<li><strong>Manage Location Services</strong> – Location tools are useful for navigating new places but can also expose your location to criminals. Turn off location services when you’re not actively using that feature, and consider limiting how you share your location on social media.</li>\n<li><strong>Enable Multifactor Authentication (MFA)</strong> – MFA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second verification form, such as a text message code, authenticator code, or fingerprint scan. This feature should be enabled for all accounts containing sensitive information before leaving your house.</li>\n<li><strong>Disable Auto-Connect Features</strong> – Some devices automatically seek and connect to available wireless networks. These features can give cybercriminals access to your devices if you connect to the wrong network. Disable this option so you only connect to wireless and Bluetooth networks you know and trust.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You should be able to relax on vacation. Taking these simple precautions can help you keep your device secure so you can enjoy your time off and don’t have to worry about dealing with cyber issues when you get back to work.</p>\n<p>However, it’s important to know that these steps aren’t fail-proof. To truly ensure that your company’s cybersecurity measures are up to standard, it’s important to work with a professional IT team that can monitor your network 24/7, patch any vulnerabilities that pop up (which happens regularly), and alert you if something seems suspicious.</p>\n<p>To help you prepare for your vacation and have peace of mind knowing your business is secure while you or your employees are working remotely, call NPI at <span><span>385-463-3366</span></span> or <a href=\"/discoverycall/\">click here</a> to schedule a FREE IT Security Risk Assessment with our cybersecurity experts today.

They want prompt service that does everything possible to solve their problem as quickly as possible. When this doesn’t happen, there’s a good chance they’ll tell others about their experience — and if many customers experience poor customer service, your company’s reputation will suffer.</p>\n<p>In response, many businesses are adopting cloud solutions to improve customer service and support. A cloud-based support platform offers some significant advantages that allow you to deliver remarkable customer experiences.</p>\n<h2>What Cloud-Based Customer Service Platforms Will Do For Your Business</h2>\n<p>Cloud solutions allow your customer service team to access the tools and information they need to provide exceptional service remotely via the internet. Instead of relying on a system that stores and manages data onsite, which can present limitations in terms of storage, scalability, and connectivity, a cloud-based customer service platform provides a comprehensive suite of features that meet both customer and service agent needs.</p>\n<p>When you choose a cloud solution to level up your customer service, your business benefits from:</p>\n<h3>Reliability</h3>\n<p>Reliable cloud systems allow customers to contact your company via multiple methods, including phone, chat, and email.  This helps your customers feel like a priority, and the potential for service requests to fall through the cracks drops. You also don’t need to worry about the reliability of your onsite servers, thanks to a lower risk for crashes, glitches, or other problems that can arise with onsite systems.</p>\n<h3>Seamless Integration With Other Business Tools</h3>\n<p>A customer service platform that integrates with your other business tools, such as CRM or inventory management software, also improves service. These integrations can support self-serve or AI-driven tools, like chatbots, but also allow human service providers to access critical information they need to address customer concerns. Integrations can also streamline services by increasing accessibility to customer data: when someone contacts you, the cloud system can immediately route the message to the right person and automatically present pertinent information.</p>\n<h3>Improved Security</h3>\n<p>Cloud solutions implement additional security measures to ensure the safety of data in transit and in storage, including encryption. Most cloud platforms also provide additional support for security, including services to prevent and mitigate breaches. This provides customers with increased confidence in your security protocols.</p>\n<h3>Insights From Real-Time Analytics</h3>\n<p>The best cloud-based customer service solutions provide real-time analytics and offer valuable insights into your customer service team’s performance, as well as the platform’s performance. You can easily measure performance indicators like the time to answer calls and the time spent on calls, or gather insights from chat logs, such as the most common customer queries or concerns, that you can use to improve other areas of your business.</p>\n<h3>Cost-Effective Customer Service</h3>\n<p>Investing in cloud solutions for customer service management helps improve cost efficiency without sacrificing service. Instead of investing in physical infrastructure, which will eventually require an upgrade, you can subscribe to a platform that allows you to improve service while simultaneously having a positive impact on the bottom line.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sitesdev.net/articles/2024/06/27/improving-customer-support-with-cloud-solutions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Used with permission from Article Aggregator</a></p>"},{"title":" Frustrated With BAD Tech Support?

While I typically try to stay clear of Reddit and its gang of chronic whiny-pants commenters, I scrolled through a few, you know, for research purposes since I’m in the industry. A few of the complaints sounded so outlandish – like the lady who claimed the technician took a bathroom break in her attic – that it almost seemed impossible they could be true. However, other more common issues on the thread I’ve experienced myself, and to be candid with you, they sucked!</p>\n<p>When you are experiencing a tech emergency – be it a broken printer, hardware malfunctions, Internet connectivity issues, login troubles or something similar – poor tech support only worsens the irritation. It leaves you with frustrated employees who can’t efficiently get their jobs done because they’re troubleshooting their tech and on hold with an IT company that is “looking into it” and irritated customers who just want a smooth process when dealing with your organization.</p>\n<p>This can result in losing customers and A-player employees to your competitors that don’t have these same daily issues. At first, it might seem dramatic that a few unresolved “tech issues” could cause such a stir, but as these problems continue to repeat themselves, with no solution in sight, resentment grows and will eventually result in these people seeking organizations that don’t have to deal with such headaches.</p>\n<p><strong>What can you do to get ahead of the problem?</strong> Start by polling your employees. Ask them questions that will help you “grade” your current IT company to see if they’re dealing with your team as fast and efficiently as they should. Here are a few questions to ask:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do you experience any recurring technical problems that haven’t been fully resolved? If so, what are they?</li>\n<li>How would you rate the response time of the IT support team when you encounter a technical issue?</li>\n<li>Have you found the IT support team to be knowledgeable and helpful in resolving your issues?</li>\n<li>Do you feel that the IT company communicates effectively and keeps you informed about the status of your requests?</li>\n<li>How would you describe your overall satisfaction with the support provided by our IT company?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These questions take only a few minutes to answer and can help you gain valuable insight into whether or not your current IT team is properly handling issues or if there is trouble brewing within your organization that you weren’t aware of.</p>\n<p>If you would like to see what good IT support actually looks like, we’ll do TWO FREE hours of support for your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are SOME of the ways you could use your time with us:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diagnose any computer network problem you are experiencing.</li>\n<li>Check your network’s security against hacker attacks and viruses.</li>\n<li>Scan and review spyware.</li>\n<li>Check your network backup system to make sure it is working properly.</li>\n<li>Diagnose slow, unstable PCs.</li>\n<li>Have us conduct our proprietary 57-point IT Systems Security And Performance Assessment.</li>\n<li>Discuss a project or upgrade you are considering, or even get a second opinion on a quote you received.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get started, give our team a call at <span><span>385-463-3366</span></span> or <a href=\"https://www.networkprovidersinc.com/discoverycall/\">click here</a> to book your call now.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"},{"title":" Massive Layoffs In 2024 Create A Serious Threat To Your Cybersecurity","published":1719498941000,"description":"<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-13407\" src=\"https://tmtdemo.axionthemes.com/files/2024/06/July_Blog2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /> The massive wave of layoffs in 2024 brings a cybersecurity threat that most business owners aren’t focusing on – offboarding employees.

Even big-time brands that you would expect to have top-of-the-line cybersecurity systems, processes and procedures in place fail to adequately protect themselves from insider threats. This August marks a year since two disgruntled Tesla employees went rogue after being let go and exposed the personal information – including names, addresses, phone numbers and even the Social Security numbers – of over 75,000 people, including employees.</p>\n<p>And, of course, the issue is expected to get worse. According to NerdWallet, as of May 24, 2024, 298 US-based tech companies have laid off 84,600 workers and counting. This includes major layoffs at big companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft, as well as smaller tech start-ups. In total, around 257,254 jobs were eliminated in the first quarter of 2024 alone.</p>\n<p>Whether or not you’ll need to downsize your team this year, having a proper offboarding process in place is essential to every business, big or small, because it’s more than a routine administrative task – it’s a critical security precaution. Failing to revoke access for former employees can lead to serious business and legal implications later.</p>\n<p><strong>Some of those issues include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Theft Of Intellectual Property </strong>–<strong> Employees can sneak away with YOUR company’s files, client data and confidential information stored on personal devices</strong>, as well as retain access to cloud-based applications like social media sites and file-sharing sites (Dropbox or OneDrive, for example) that your IT department doesn’t know about or forgets to change the password to. <strong>A study by Osterman Research revealed that 69% of businesses experience data loss due to employee turnover, and 87% of employees who leave take data with them.</strong> Most often, the information you worked hard to gather is sold to competitors, used by them when they’re hired by the competition or used by the former employee to BECOME a competitor. Any way you cut it, it screws YOU.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compliance Violations </strong>– Failing to revoke access privileges and remove employees from authorized user lists can register you as noncompliant in heavily regulated industries. This simple mistake can result in large fines, hefty penalties and, in some cases, legal consequences.</li>\n<li><strong>They DELETE Everything </strong>– If an employee feels unfairly laid-off and retains access to their accounts, they could easily delete ALL of their e-mails and any critical files they can get their hands on. If that data isn’t backed up, you will lose it ALL. And for those thinking, “I’ll sue them!” Rightfully so, but even if you do sue them and win, the hard reality is that the legal costs, time wasted on the lawsuit and recovering the data, plus the aggravation and distraction of dealing with it all, are greater costs than what you <em>might</em> get awarded if you win the lawsuit and <em>might</em> collect in damages.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Breach </strong>– This could be the most terrifying of all. Unhappy employees who feel they have been wronged can make you the star of the next devastating data breach headline and incur a costly lawsuit to go with it. It could be as simple as making one click and downloading, exposing or modifying your clients’ or employees’ private information, financial records or even trade secrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you have an airtight offboarding process to curb these risks? Chances are you don’t. A 2024 study by Wing revealed that one out of five organizations has indications that some of their former users were not properly offboarded, and those are the people who were astute enough to detect it.</p>\n<p><strong>How DO you properly offboard an employee?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Implement The Principle Of Least Privilege</strong> – Successful offboarding starts with proper onboarding. New employees should ONLY be given access to the files and programs they need to do their jobs. This should be meticulously documented to make offboarding easier.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage Automation</strong> – Your IT team can help use automation to streamline revoking access to multiple software applications simultaneously, saving time and resources while reducing the likelihood of manual errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Implement Continuous Monitoring </strong>– You can implement software that tracks who is doing what and where on the company network. This can help you identify suspicious behavior by an unauthorized user and help you determine if a former employee retains access to private accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are only a few ways your IT team can help improve your offboarding process to make it more efficient and secure.</p>\n<p>Insider threats can be devastating, and if you think this can’t happen to you, think again.

Do you know if you have adequate protection in place to stop cyber threats? Are you certain that you’re in compliance with all applicable security rules that apply to your business?</p>\n<p>If you answer “no” to any of these questions, you need to make cyber security a priority and implement regular IT audits to identify and address security vulnerabilities. Discover more about this process below.</p>\n<h2>What Is an IT Audit?</h2>\n<p>An IT audit is a thorough checkup and assessment of your IT infrastructure. The purpose is to make sure that all the systems and solutions are working correctly, the management and operation of the systems are in alignment with best practices, company policies, and applicable regulations, and that data is collected, used, and protected appropriately.</p>\n<p>More specifically, the process includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluating hardware and software to ensure that it’s working efficiently and identify opportunities for upgrades</li>\n<li>Assessing system performance and capacity and identifying areas for efficiency improvement</li>\n<li>Conducting compliance checks to ensure your company is following the rules of HIPAA, PCI-DSS, Security and Exchange Commission, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any other applicable standards</li>\n<li>Confirming documentation of IT processes, policies, and procedures to ensure they are complete, compliant, and up-to-date</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, regular IT audits also address security, identifying security vulnerabilities or loopholes that a cyber criminal could exploit to attack and harm your business.</p>\n<h2>What You Gain From Regular IT Audits</h2>\n<p>A thorough IT audit is an important risk management tool. Much like a regular visit to your doctor allows them to catch minor concerns before they become a major health issue, checking up on your IT infrastructure ensures you identify small issues before they become big and expensive headaches.</p>\n<p>The process of the audit itself requires planning, gathering data, and analysis. The insights that come from this effort become recommendations for improvement, and guide action plans moving forward. Although the process can be time-consuming, it offers your business a long list of benefits.</p>\n<h3>A More Secure IT Environment</h3>\n<p>Security audits help protect your business from malware, data breaches, and other threats. The process evaluates logical and physical security, data integrity and security, incident management procedures, and more, ensuring your company is doing everything possible to address threats.</p>\n<h3>Improved Efficiency and Cost Savings</h3>\n<p>IT audits identify areas of improvement that can help your business be more productive and efficient and, ultimately, save money. For example, a detailed review of the infrastructure and its capabilities may reveal areas that allow for automation or processes that could benefit from streamlining.</p>\n<h3>Better Compliance</h3>\n<p>Regular IT audits help you stay abreast of constantly changing compliance standards and industry standards. Prioritizing compliance helps you gain the trust of key stakeholders and enhance your company’s reputation.</p>\n<h3>Comprehensive Planning</h3>\n<p>The insights you gain from a comprehensive IT audit can support more strategic planning to support the future of your company. You can plan ahead for investments in equipment or capabilities that support your growth goals and future expansion.</p>\n<p>Keep your business running smoothly and prepare for the future by implementing a program of regular IT audits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sitesdev.net/articles/2024/06/26/the-importance-of-regular-it-audits/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Used with permission from Article Aggregator</a></p>"},{"title":" Apple’s New Password Manager","published":1719327600000,"description":"<img class=\"size-full wp-image-17293 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.networkprovidersinc.com/files/2024/06/Untitled-design-2024-06-24T140446.024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />If you’re a business owner and a long-time Apple user, you’re likely aware of and use iCloud Keychain for your company.

This built-in password manager offers unique autofill, sync, and recovery features on all iPhones, iPads, and Mac products that your employees probably use to secure private information. However, Apple’s new password manager, announced at WWDC 2024, is about to take protection to another level.</span></p>\n<p><b>What Is the New Password Manager?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As an extension of iCloud Keychain, the new standalone password manager app stores business passwords more safely and securely than ever. T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">here’s plenty to look forward to with the new release, including how it provides codes and security alerts and syncs more devices.</span></p>\n<p><b>Syncing All Accounts and Devices for Easier Use and Better Accessibility</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Typically, 1Password, Bitwarden, and other third-party password managers require you to go into the settings of each device to access, edit, and delete credentials for all your online accounts. Otherwise, Apple users rely on the Safari preferences window or Mac System Preferences to retrieve saved passwords. In these cases, information is spread out across platforms and disorganized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The new Passwords app places all passwords in one easy-to-reach place. Furthermore, it automatically updates whenever you introduce a new smart product to your business space with a new password or code. You can easily secure more passwords, especially since this new iOS 18 feature allows you to sync Vision Pro headsets and PCs if you have the Windows app, which you couldn’t do before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All data remains clear and concise, from login credentials to Wi-Fi passwords, and the data automatically fills in, so you don’t have to waste time searching for the information. You can also share the credentials among trusted employees by granting them access to family- or business-sharing setups that facilitate manageability and fluency between devices. </span></p>\n<p><b>Generating Codes and Providing Alerts for Optimal Safety</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Apple’s new password manager also has a hand in generating verification codes for optimal safety. For instance, if your employees use two-step verification to help reduce the potential for hacker threats and company data leaks, they can trust this system to create a unique one-time code and securely send it to them like an authenticator app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, if the system notices unauthorized actions, it’ll quickly send security alerts to warn you and your employees about a potential threat. For instance, if someone uses a new device to log into the company account or changes certain passwords, a warning will go out to ensure your company authorized these actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, if you’re ready to opt out of third-party passkey managers and into a more reliable one, credit Apple for its new password manager. With it, you can use Apple Vision Pro to access passwords and eventually access PC accounts with the upcoming Windows version. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sitesdev.net/articles/2024/06/25/apples-new-password-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Used with permission from Article Aggregator</a></p>"},{"title":" Securing Your Business With Multi-Factor Authentication","published":1719241200000,"description":"<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-17164 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.networkprovidersinc.com/files/2024/06/business-should-use-mfa-resized-300x206.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" />Most people expect to enter a username and password to access secure networks and accounts online.

They also expect that password protection for sensitive data will stop unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, single-factor authentication is no longer enough to fully secure your business networks and resources. Password theft is one of the leading causes of data breaches, with hackers using stolen credentials to access sensitive information and wreak havoc on businesses. However, by taking a multi-layered approach to cyber security that uses multi-factor authentication, you stand a better chance of thwarting bad actors and keeping your business data safe.</p>\n<h2>What Is Multi-Factor Authentication?</h2>\n<p>The typical username and password combination that we’re all familiar with is a type of single-factor authentication. In order to access a protected asset, you only need a single factor (in this case, the password) to prove you have permission to do so.</p>\n<p>Multi-factor authentication requires several pieces of information for user verification. In most cases, these include the username and password, as well as another token, like a unique code. These additional authentication factors help ensure that even in the event of a password compromise, whoever has the password won’t be able to go any further because they don’t have the additional details.</p>\n<p>Authentication factors can come in a variety of forms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Biometrics,</strong> such as a fingerprint or facial recognition</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile apps</strong> that continuously generate one-time passwords to enter in addition to your standard username and password</li>\n<li><strong>SMS texts</strong>, which deliver a one-time code to a mobile device</li>\n<li><strong>Hardware tokens</strong>, which are physical devices that generate one-time codes or that you insert into a device in addition to a password</li>\n<li><strong>Security questions</strong> that the user establishes at account setup</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why You Need Multiple Security Layers</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, implementing several security layers helps reduce the risk of many common cyber threats that can cost your business time and money. Considering that many small and midsize businesses never fully recover from a cyber attack, investing in multi-factor authentication is an important element of a robust approach to security.</p>\n<p>Using multi-factor authentication offers several major advantages.</p>\n<h3>Increased Protection</h3>\n<p>Even if you run a small business, there’s always a threat of attack. Hackers use a variety of methods to steal passwords, like brute force attacks, social engineering, and date packet sniffing, but if you have multi-factor authentication in place, simply getting those passwords isn’t enough to get into your network.</p>\n<p>Requiring additional information before granting access to sensitive assets allows your cyber security team to focus on other priorities. It’s just one tool of many that they can use to address the barrage of threats coming from every direction.</p>\n<h3>Simplicity</h3>\n<p>Using this type of security is easy. It takes the typical user only a few seconds to generate and enter a code. Considering the many hours it takes to respond to a data breach, not to mention the impact that one will have on your business’s reputation and bottom line, there’s really no comparison.</p>\n<p>Cyber threats are always evolving, but multi-factor authentication is a simple and effective way to proactively protect your business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sitesdev.net/articles/2024/06/24/securing-your-business-with-multi-factor-authentication/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Used with permission from Article Aggregator</a></p>"},{"title":" Using Technology to Enhance Customer Loyalty Programs","published":1719068400000,"description":"<img class=\"size-full wp-image-17103 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.networkprovidersinc.com/files/2024/06/business-tech-reward-program-resized.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />How connected is your business?

Have you gone so far as to implement the latest technology into your point of sale, marketing efforts, or customer loyalty programs? If not, you’re missing a huge opportunity.</p>\n<p>Small businesses–establishments with 500 workers or less–comprise 99.9% of the economy, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. That averages 33,185,550 companies employing about 61.7 million Americans in total. Astoundingly, while small-to-medium businesses make up most of our professional sector, <em>only 38% use specialized technology</em>–like enhancing customer loyalty programs to rival bigger brands.</p>\n<p>Fueling your business’s digital transformation could help you adapt certain tools, like automation and cloud computing, to streamline your operation. Why not let technology help you learn about your customer activity and trends while improving the shopping experience?</p>\n<h2>Making Customer Loyalty Programs Bigger and Better</h2>\n<p>While technology can help every part of your business, digital loyalty programs are an easy place to start to see big dividends. Here are a few ideas for automating your small business loyalty program:</p>\n<h3>Personalizing Customer Interactions = Better Experiences</h3>\n<p>Think of shopping as research for your potential customers. They scroll through your site to see if you offer anything interesting. If they find something, they might click on it, save it, or even add it to the cart.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t recording how your customers’ research into your products or services is going, you can’t analyze them or make improvements to the shopping experience. That’s where the right technology comes in. With automated customer loyalty technology, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Note browsing habits to better recommend similar products or styles.</li>\n<li>Pick up abandoned carts by retargeting ads, reducing prices, or offering someone an incentive to complete their purchase with you.</li>\n<li>Streamline personalization to strengthen each customer’s emotional connection to your brand.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Flaunting Incentives = Better Engagement</h3>\n<p>How does your current system increase customer engagement? Have you considered gamification? This approach allows your customers to use mobile technology to earn points for shopping or other activities or top leaderboards to make things competitive or fun.</p>\n<p>Whether that’s an app or promotions on social media platforms, you can ramp up the engagement and reach more people with digital stamp cards, prizes, and more. Software management tools make tracking these rewards and referral programs simple. Technology does the work for you.</p>\n<h3>Gaining Customer Insight = Better ROI for Bigger Company Growth</h3>\n<p>The thing with digital stamps or punch cards is not only that they entice customers–they also help your business gain better insight into the overall customer experience on offer. Unlike with traditional paper punch cards or stickers, online programs give you an accurate and updated card count for customer loyalty measurement. You’ll even see how many rewards you currently owe so that you can budget resources efficiently.</p>\n<p>Why not use advanced data analytics to show weaknesses in your program, remove any demotivating features, or make other parts of your strategy excel? With technology, you can create, distribute, and track wholly unique marketing campaigns across a much larger audience for great ROI. Who says small business customer loyalty programs have to stay small?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sitesdev.net/articles/2024/06/22/using-technology-to-enhance-customer-loyalty-programs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Used with permission from Article Aggregator</a></p>"},{"title":" Zoom Introduces Post-Quantum End-to-End Encryption","published":1718982000000,"description":"<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-17121 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.networkprovidersinc.com/files/2024/06/zoom-meeting-business-ee2e-privacy-resized-300x206.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" />Zoom Introduces Post-Quantum End-to-End Encryption The security features of Zoom are getting a big boost.

Post-quantum end-to-end encryption (E2EE) is now available in Zoom Meetings. This new encryption standard will soon be offered in Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms.</p>\n<p>End-to-end encryption scrambles the call’s content so that only the people involved can read it. Businesses that deal with private data during video conferences need this security feature.</p>\n<p><b>Why Post-Quantum Encryption? </b></p>\n<p>While traditional encryption methods are currently secure, the development of quantum computers raises concerns. Quantum computers operate on different principles than traditional computers and could theoretically break encryption codes used today.</p>\n<p>This challenge is answered by post-quantum encryption. Even a powerful quantum computer would find it much harder to crack because it uses different mathematical principles than traditional encryption.</p>\n<p><b>Protecting Against “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” Attacks </b></p>\n<p>Another reason for post-quantum encryption is to guard against “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. In this scenario, attackers steal encrypted data today, knowing they can’t decrypt it yet. However, they hope to crack the code later with quantum computers.</p>\n<p>Zoom aims to make this type of attack ineffective by using post-quantum encryption. Even if attackers capture encrypted data from a Zoom meeting, they couldn’t decrypt it in the future, even with a quantum computer.</p>\n<p><b>What This Means for Zoom Users </b></p>\n<p>The new post-quantum E2EE is currently available for Zoom Meetings. To benefit from this enhanced security, all participants in a meeting need to be using Zoom desktop or mobile app version 6.0.10 or higher. If some participants are using older versions, the meeting will default to the standard E2EE.</p>\n<p>Zoom emphasizes that standard and post-quantum E2EE keep the encryption keys private from Zoom’s servers. This means Zoom itself cannot decrypt the content of your meetings.</p>\n<p><b>Benefits for Businesses </b></p>\n<p>Post-quantum encryption benefits businesses, especially those handling sensitive data online:</p>\n<p>Enhanced security. Businesses can protect confidential communications and data from quantum computer threats by using post-quantum encryption.</p>\n<p>Lower compliance risk. Many industries require strict data security rules. Post-quantum encryption helps businesses comply with regulations and avoid penalties by protecting data proactively.</p>\n<p>Competitive advantage. Businesses that prioritize user privacy and security can gain a competitive edge. Offering post-quantum encryption as part of their video conferencing platform allows companies to position themselves as trustworthy partners.</p>\n<p>Future-proofing communications. The development of quantum computing is still in its early stages, but the potential impact on encryption can’t be ignored. By adopting post-quantum encryption, businesses can ensure their video conferencing infrastructure remains secure.</p>\n<p><b>The Future of Encryption </b></p>\n<p>Quantum computers are still being developed, but the fact that Zoom is using post-quantum encryption is part of a larger trend in the tech world. Many businesses are taking similar steps to ensure their communications will be secure for years to come.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sitesdev.net/articles/2024/06/21/zoom-introduces-post-quantum-end-to-end-encryption/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Used with permission from Article Aggregator</a></p>"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
