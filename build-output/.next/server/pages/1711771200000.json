However, Pompompurin, the owner of the hacking forum Breached, stated they were responsible for exploiting the API bug and platforming the data after another hacker shared the vulnerability with them.</p><p>The stolen data includes public information like Twitter IDs, account names, logins, locations, and verified status. In addition, private information like phone numbers and email addresses have also been exposed. Fraudulent activities such as phishing could be carried out using this information.</p><p>In addition to the breach of the 5.4 million active accounts, private information for roughly 1.4 million suspended Twitter profiles were also shared using the same API bug.
